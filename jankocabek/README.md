# Time Management App

## Overview
This application helps users manage their time effectively by allowing them to create and organize tasks with detailed operations. The project has been developed with an object-oriented programming approach, focusing on reusable components and immediate rendering of changes.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Create tasks with titles and descriptions
- **Operation Management**: Add detailed operations for each task
- **Real-time Updates**: All changes are rendered and updated immediately
- **Interactive UI**: Fully functional buttons for all operations

## Technical Details
- **Development Approach**: Object-Oriented Programming
- **Code Structure**: Focuses on reusable functions and components
- **Current Size**: Approximately 475 lines of code
- **Status**: First fully functional version

## Implementation Notes
- All functionality described in the LMS (Learning Management System) has been implemented
- The code has been written with a personal approach rather than following the LMS examples directly
- Contains debugging logs from development process (may be removed in future updates)

## Next Steps
- Remove commented debugging logs
- Review code for optimization opportunities
- Explore possibilities to shorten or improve code structure

## Contributors
- Original concept from LMS
- Current implementation by Jan Koc√°bek

## Project Status
This is the first fully functional version where all buttons perform their intended actions and all elements render and delete immediately.
